# VirtualPageTableRegister
The project is coded on java. 
It contains 3 classes: 
	Item: one lined item in VPTR, including: page, frame, sector, isValid, count (for FIFO algorithm).
	VirtualPageTableRegister: with each Program Counter generated, it updates the VPTR and shows whether there is a page fault and output logical and physical address.
	Main: Run the project continuously, until the operator chooses to exit.

Note:
1. The victim page is selected by FIFO algorithm.
	2. Each program will update PC randomly times. In this project, I set the update times is 
2* page number, to show my VPTR works well and make output not that long.

Caution:
	The input page number and frame number must be positive numbers. Otherwise, it wonâ€™t work well. (If the input page number or frame number is invalid(negative or greater than the max number), it will ask to reinput.)
